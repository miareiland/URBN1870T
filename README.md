# Data on Moped Crashes in New York City 

Hello and welcome to my project on moped crashes in New York City. 

This code serves as some data analysis for a project I am working on to redesign two lanes of the Williamsburg Bridge in the interest of micro mobility users, including moped users. As of now, there is no legal way for a moped user to travel from Brooklyn to Manhattan, or Queens to Manhattan. 

Here, I used crash data from the City of New York in order to 1) create an interactive heat map to demonstrate the location of moped crashes, and 2) generate graphs on the causes, times, and vehicles involved in moped crashes.
